# Summary

## NP Complete

- NP complete problems doesnt have known fast solutions
- Greedy algorithms optimize locally, to optimize globally.
- If you have a NP complete problem, you could use a approximation algorithm
- To make the approximation algorithms easy to write and fast to run, we could use greedy algorithms
