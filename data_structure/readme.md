# Data Structures

## Ways to store data in memory
- Manage data efficiently
- What type of organization? Sequential or not?
- How to search, insert, remove?
- Which operation is most important?
- What is the asymptotic complexity? [Big-O notation](./big-o/)


## Structures: 
- [Stacks](./stack/) - Ordered (type of list)
- [Queues](./queues/) - Ordered (type of list)
- [Lists](./lists/) - Ordered
- [Trees](./trees/) - Hierarchical Relationships between elements
- [Graphs](./graphs/) - Generic and can organize and relate elements.
  
## ATD (Abstract types of data)

- Focus in operations of a data type and we abstract ourselves from how
it has been implemented. 
- User just see interface, no the implementation.
