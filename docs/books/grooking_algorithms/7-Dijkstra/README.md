# Dijkstra

- Breadth First Search is used to calculate the shortest path on a unweighted graph
- Dijkstra's algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path on a weighted graph
- This algorithm works just with all weights as positive
- When we have negative weights, we can use Bellman-Ford algorithm
